# My Website

This is the source code for my static personal website, made with love by ME. The buck of my work stops here at these files. The steps for converting these into a browser-ready website is a bit more complicated.

1. Depending on your chosen OS, follow the steps for [downloading and installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this repository.
3. Execute these statements to install the necessary dependencies, build the website, and serve it from a locally assigned port:
```
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
